<h1 align="center">Personal Portfolio Website</h1>
<h3 align="center">My first front-end project written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and JQuery</h3>
<p align="left">With this project I demonstrate my ability to work with web development technologies to bring a project to life</p>
<br><br>
<h3 align="center">What I leared through this project:</h2>

-  Gained an understanding of designing a responsive website,
-  Working with an API, in this instance to create a custom contact form,
-  Validate user input utilising HASH tables, 
-  Utilising canvas animations to bring the website to life,
-  Writing intersection observers to display content in a more dynamic way.

<h2 align="center">Whats next:</h2>
<p align="center">I plan to write a new portfolio to meet my current standard, utilising modern frameworks and 3d animations with the help of Three.js to create a visually stunning and feature rich portfolio</p>
